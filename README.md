# Competitive Programming Solutions

This Github repository contains my personal computational solutions to (competitive) programming problems. 

Though my solutions may not be the most optimal solution to a certain problem (and can, at times, feature very questionable implementation and logic), they have worked for me nonetheless at the time of coding.

Current repository problems originate from:

- [AtCoder](./AtCoder/) ([link](https://atcoder.jp/))

- [FreeCodeCamp](./FreeCodeCamp/) ([link](https://www.freecodecamp.org)) (not competitive programming)
