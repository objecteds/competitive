# Problem Statement

["Possum Magic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possum_Magic) is an Australian chidren's book.

Write a program to print this sentence from the book:

    Grandma Poss made bush magic.

This is like the last problem, but now you have to write the whole program yourself!

1. Use a `print` statement to print `'Grandma Poss made bush magic.'`
2. Run your program...
3. Mark your program!
