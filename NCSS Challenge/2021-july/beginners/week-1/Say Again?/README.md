# Problem Statement

You're writing a conversation between two people at a very loud train station.

1. Click Run to see what you have so far.

2. Change the `person1` and `person2` variables to try out some new lines:

    The first person should say `'What platform is this?'`

    The second person should then say `'Huh?'`

3. Run your program again. It should print the following:

        What platform is this?
        Huh?
        What platform is this?
        Sorry, can you say that again?
        What?
        Huh?

4. Mark your program!
