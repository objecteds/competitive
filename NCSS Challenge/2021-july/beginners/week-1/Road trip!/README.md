# Problem Statement

You're going on a road trip!

Let's work out how far you're going.
- You travel at 75 kilometres per hour.
- You drive for 6 hours a day.
- You're going for 14 days.

If you multiply (×) these numbers together, you'll find how far you will go this trip!

We've started the program for you.

1. The `days` variable is set to 0. It needs the correct value. Type in how many days you're going for.
2. Set the `km_in_trip` variable to calculate:

    **speed x hours per day x days**

3. The `print` statement prints the `km_in_trip` variable. Click run to see if it prints the correct answer:
        
        6300

4. Don't forget to mark your program!
