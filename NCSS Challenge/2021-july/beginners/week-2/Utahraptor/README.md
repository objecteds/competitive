# Problem Statement

[Utahraptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utahraptor) is a [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) of dinosaur discovered in Utah, in 1975. Dinosaurs are often named for the location where their fossils are first discovered.

Write a program to name more dinosaurs by adding `raptor` to a location, like this:

    Location? Utah
    Utahraptor

This is like the last problem, but now you're writing all the code yourself!

1. Ask for `input` with the prompt `Location?` and save it to a variable.

    <b>Remember the <em>space</em> after the question mark.</b>

2. `print` out an f-string with the variable and then `raptor`. Remember to put `{` before the variable and `}` after it.

    <b>Make sure there <em>isn't</em> a space after</b> `raptor`.

3. Run your program and try it with `Utah`.

    **Your program should also work with other Locations.**

        Location? Sydney
        Sydneyraptor

    *Remember, the* `blue text` *is output, while* `black text` *is input*.

4. Run your program again and now try `Sydney`.

5. Test it with other names! When you think it's right, mark your program to check it.
