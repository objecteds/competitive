# Problem Statement

You want to build a tower out of markers. You need 25 marker pens. Write a program to help you know if you've found enough.

If you've found **fewer than 25 marker pens** it should say:

    How many markers have you found? 11
    You need to find more markers.

Otherwise, it should say:

    How many markers have you found? 34
    Yay! You can build the tower!

1. Ask for how many markers you've found with `input` and convert it to a number with `int`.

2. Add an `if` and an `else` to check the number. If it is *less than* `25` then `print` out `You need to find more markers`. or else `print` out `Yay! You can build the tower!`

3. Run your program and check it with the first example: `11`. Then check it with the second example: `34`.

4. Mark your program to check your work!
