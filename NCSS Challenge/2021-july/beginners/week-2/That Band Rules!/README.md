# Problem Statement

Let's make a program to compliment people on their taste in music!

It should work like this:

    Favourite band? Kuren
    Kuren rules!

We've given you some example code to start with. You will need to modify it to solve this problem.

1. The program has a variable named `animal`. That's not a very good variable name for our new program!

    Change it to be `band` instead.

2. Update the `input` prompt to print `Favourite band?`

    <b>Remember to put a <em>space</em> after the question mark.</b>

3. Change the `print` statement so that it prints the band name followed by `rules!`

    Make sure you have an `f` at the beginning of the f-string, and put the `band` variable inside curly braces.

    <b>Also make sure there <em>isn't</em> a space after the exclamation point.</b>

4. Run your program and try it with `Kuren`.

5. **Your program should also work with other bands.**

    Run your program again and this time try `Montaigne`.

        Favourite band? Montaigne
        Montaigne rules!

6. Now try out your own examples! When you're happy mark your program to check it.
