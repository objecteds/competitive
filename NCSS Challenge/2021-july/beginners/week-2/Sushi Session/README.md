# Problem Statement

You're meeting up with a friend to grab some lunch.

Let's write a program that asks where you're going for lunch. The program should always reply `Meet you there!`

    Time for lunch!
    Where are we going? falafels
    Meet you there!

If you say you're going to `sushi` it should also tell you `I love sushi!`

    Time for lunch!
    Where are we going? sushi
    I love sushi!
    Meet you there!

1. Start by printing `Time for lunch!`

2. Ask the user where they're going for lunch using `input` and store it for later. Remember to put a space after the question mark!

3. Add an `if` statement to check if the user entered the word `sushi`. If they do, your program should respond with `I love sushi!`

4. Your program should always print out `Meet you there!` at the end.

    ðŸ¤” *Should the print statement be inside or outside of the `if` statement?*

5. Don't forget to run your code before you mark it!
