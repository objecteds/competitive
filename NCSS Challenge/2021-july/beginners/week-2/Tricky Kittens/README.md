The Guinness World Record for the most tricks by a cat in one minute is held by [Didga the cat](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/391893-most-tricks-performed-by-a-cat-in-one-minute). The record is **24** tricks.

Write a program that asks how many tricks your cat can do. If the number is **greater than 24** then it should do this:

    How many tricks? 28
    New world record!

Otherwise it should do this:

    How many tricks? 5
    No record yet. Keep training!

1. Ask for the number of `tricks` with `input` and convert it to a number with `int`.

2. Add an `if` to check if the number of `tricks` is *greater than* `24`. If it is *greater than* `24` then `print` out `New world record!`

    *Reminder: The greater than symbol is >*

3. Add an `else` to the end. Inside the `else` statement, `print` out `No record yet. Keep training!`

4. Run your program and check it with the first example: `28`. Then check it with the second example: `5`.

5. Mark your program, to check your work!
