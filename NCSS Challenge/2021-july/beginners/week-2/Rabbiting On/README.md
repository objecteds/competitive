# Problem Statement

You have a friend who's obsessed with [Watership Down.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down) Write a program to talk to your friend.

Your program should ask for their favourite book. If they say `Watership Down`, it should print `Yes! Bigwig is awesome!`

    What is your favourite book? Watership Down
    Yes! Bigwig is awesome!

If they say anything else, it should print: `I like that, but it needs more rabbits.`

    What is your favourite book? Harry Potter
    I like that, but it needs more rabbits.

1. Use `input` to ask `What is your favourite book?` and save the answer in a `variable`.

    *Remember to put a space after the question mark.*

2. Write an `if` statement to check if their favourite book is `'Watership Down'`.

3. If it’s True, print `Yes! Bigwig is awesome!`. Make sure there *isn’t* a space after the exclamation point.

4. Add an `else` statement before printing out the other response. Check that there *isn't* a space at the end of it.

5. Don't forget to run your code before you mark it!
