You're a big fan of cheese, but sometimes you can't remember if a word is a kind of cheese or something else!

We've given you a list called `cheeses` which has some kinds of cheese in it.

Write a program that asks for a cheese and checks if the cheese is in the list. If the cheese is in the list, it should print:

    Cheese: Haloumi
    Haloumi is a cheese!

If the cheese isn't in the list it should print:

    Cheese: Pita
    Pita might not be a cheese.
