# Problem Statement 

According to the [U.S. census data](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/1990_census/1990_census_namefiles.html), in 1990, only 0.27% of surnames started with the letter Q and only 0.82% of surnames contained the letter Q. Write a program that asks the user for their surname and tells them how rare their surname is based on the letter Q.

If their surname starts with the letter Q, your program should print out `You have an extremely rare surname!` For example:

    What is your surname? Quinn
    You have an extremely rare surname!

Otherwise, if their surname contains a letter Q, your program should print out `You have a rare surname!` For example:

    What is your surname? Rodriquez
    You have a rare surname!

Otherwise, if their surname does not contain a letter Q, your program should print out `No Qs here`. For example:

    What is your surname? Smith
    No Qs here.

Your program should ignore the case of the letters when performing these tests. That is, both uppercase and lowercase Qs should be counted.
