# Problem Statement

An [autobiographical number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-descriptive_number#Autobiographical_numbers) is a number where the first digit from the left counts how many of the digit zero is in the number, the second digit counts how many of the digit one is in the number, and so forth up to the tenth digit. If the number has more than ten digits, it is not autobiographical.

For example, 21200 is an autobiographical number because it contains:

* 2 zeroes
* 1 one
* 2 twos
* 0 threes
* 0 fours

Write a program that reads an integer from the user, and prints out whether or not the integer is autobiographical. Here are three examples of how your program should work:

    Number: 21200
    21200 is autobiographical.
‎

    Number: 3211000
    3211000 is autobiographical.
‎

    Number: 63100010001
    63100010001 is not autobiographical.
