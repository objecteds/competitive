*Excerpt from https://groklearning.com/challenge:*
> The NCSS Challenge is a programming competition open to all school students and teachers. The <a href="https://groklearning.com">Grok Learning</a> team have been running coding competitions like the challenge for over 12 years.

The NCSS challenge is a competitive coding event created by the [National Computer Science School](https://ncss.edu.au). There are 4 various "streams" that are included within the NCSS challenge, making the challenge suitable and accessible to students with and without coding experience. 

The 4 streams include:
- Newbies
  - Perfect for young beginners.
  - The language used in this stream is Blockly, which is a no-code, block-based coding environment that is suitable for students with no experience in coding at all.
- Beginners
  - Perfect for beginners of all ages.
  - The language used in this stream is Blockly or Python. It is the best stream for most students, as it introduces fundamental computational thinking concepts.
- Intermediate
  - For experienced students, to stretch further
  - The language used in this stream is Python. Experience is required, and the stream is for students who have completed the Beginners stream and want to learn more. This stream introduces topics like data structures, files, and functions.
- Advanced
  - This stream uses Python, and experience is required. The Advanced stream is for students with significant programming experience looking to really test their skills.
  - This stream introduces topics like advanced data structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and recursion.
