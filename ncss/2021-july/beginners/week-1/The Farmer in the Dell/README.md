# Problem Statement

Here's a program that prints the first verse of [a nursery rhyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farmer_in_the_Dell).

1. Run the program to see what it does.
The `line` variable is used three times to print the song lyrics.

2. **Update the program so that it prints this different verse:**

        The mouse takes the cheese
        The mouse takes the cheese
        Hi-ho, the derry-o
        The mouse takes the cheese

    You'll need to update the `line` variable, by setting it to a new value!

3. Mark your program, fix any errors, run and mark it again.
