# Problem Statement

Your friend has written some code to convert [feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)) to [miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile).

You try it out, but it's not working! It's got a [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug)!

1. Run the program and see what happens.
2. Fix the bug!
    The error says the bug is somewhere in line 3: `miles = feet / 5280`

    The code divides `feet` by 5280.

    But `feet` is a string and not a number! Fix it by changing just the first line.

3. Run the program again and see if it works.

    It should print:

        7.0

4. Make sure to mark your program!
